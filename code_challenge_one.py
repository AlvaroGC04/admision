Code Challenge #1
Having a list of n numbers with digits in range [0, S], where n <= 100, switch all list positions in O(n)
time. If the input number contains a digit greater or equal than S, you will delete the digit from the
number, for example with S=6, 61 becomes 1, and 6 will be deleted from the array. The result
should be printed in console/terminal. Please, donâ€™t use built-in sort of your language.

Examples with S=6:
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
> [10, 20, 30, 40] -> [40, 30, 20, 10]
> [6] -> []
> [66] -> []
> [65] -> [5]
> [6, 2, 1] -> [1 , 2]
> [60, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 7, 29, 1] -> [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0]
